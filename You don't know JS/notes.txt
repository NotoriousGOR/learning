========================================================================
* Threads of execution: goes line by line and runs or executes the code

* Execution Context: An execution context is a data structure that tracks
the execution program or function. It contains the local scope, and
variable values.

* Call Stack: A queue of functions that are running or will be ran

* Higher Order Function: Any function that takes in or returns a function

* Callback Function: The function you insert into a Higher Order function

* Memory Leak: Literally wasted space in a computer's memory. ie, a variable that's never modified or used

Notes:
========================================================================
* Functions are stored as first-class objects; Meaning they have the same
properties as objects
* Even arrays are just objects behind the scenes
* On arrow functions if you have something like:
    const multiplyBy2 = (input) => input*2
  Javascript will automatically insert "{return input*2}" for you.
